# CADS-webconference-android

Native Android port of [CADS-webconference-demo](https://github.com/scimbe/CADS-webconference-demo) —
real Noise_IK/CADS-Tunnel Agent-Fabric video calling, native Rust core via UniFFI instead of a WebView.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design, the four known gaps this port fixes
(broken WebRTC fallback, no TURN, cleartext keys, narrow bridge trust model), and the
channel-to-channel feature.

Status: early scaffold, no working build yet.
